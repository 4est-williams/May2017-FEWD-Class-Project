# FrontEndWebDev-ClassProject - Louie's Pizza
Louie has the best pizza in town, but his small pizza shop is only known to some die-hard local fans.  Louie wants to expand his business and attract new customers so that more people can enjoy his amazing pizza.  Louie has contracted you to build a website for "Louie's Pizza" and he has provided you with a PDF with what he wants the final product to look like.  You will build a site that matches Louie's design in phases, with the final product being a marketing site that will help Louie grow his business.

## Challenge 1 - Starting From Scratch
In this challenge, we will scaffold our web project by creating a bare-bones html, css, and js file.  Then we'll add some simple content.  

### Scaffolding a Site
1. Create an index.html file and copy this html into your newly created file:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>title</title>

    <!-- Insert Style Sheet Here-->

    <!-- Insert Google Fonts Here -->

</head>

<body>

    <!-- Header -->

    <!-- /Header -->

    <!-- Welcome -->

    <!-- /Welcome -->

    <!-- Mail List -->

    <!-- /Mail List -->

    <!-- History -->

    <!-- /History -->

    <!-- Food Menu -->

    <!-- /Food Menu -->

    <!-- Map -->

    <!-- /Map -->

    <!-- Footer -->

    <!-- /Footer -->


    <!-- Insert JavaScript Here -->

</body>
</html>
```
2. Create a `new folder` called `css`.  Inside the new folder create a new file and name it `site.css`.
3. Create a `new folder` called `js`.  Inside the new folder create a new file and name it `site.js`.
4. In your index.html file, add the appropriate `link tag` in the `<head>` element to link your `site.css` style sheet.
5. In your index.html file, add the appropriate `script tag` before the closing `</body>` tag to include the site.js javascript file.

Now you have a basic html/css/js site to work with!

### Adding Content

Now we will add a little bit of content to our website, and add a little bit of layout.  Let's get started with the top section of the site.

1. In index.html, find the section labeled `Header` and add a `<section></section>` element.  
2. Inside the newly created `<section></section>` element, insert the following html for our head section:
```

```


5. Update to include an unordred list of links inside the _"nav"_ tag to: 
    a. Welcome
    b. History
    c. Menu
    d. Contact
6. The Header or Top section of your page should now match the site according to the site.pdf file included in this
